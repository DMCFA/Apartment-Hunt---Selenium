# ny-apartment-hunt

Python program that searches for apartments in NYC according to a specific criteria and writes that data to a google form. 

This is a Python project to help me have a better idea of apartment rentals options available in NY within a specific price amount and area.

I used the Selinium Python Framework along with the chromedriver application for this project. 

Initially I considered using BeautifulSoup too but it is more efficient to just use Selinium for everything.

After gathering the target data from the rental website and writing that data to a google form, the last step is to convert that information to csv.
